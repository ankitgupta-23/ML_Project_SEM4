        <h2>--- Brain Tumor Detection Model ---</h2><br>
        <p>Brain tumors are one of the most serious diseases in medical science.
           Effectiveness and efficacy analysis has always been a primary concern 
           of radiologists in the early stages of tumor development.
        </p>
        <p>
           The biopsy procedure requires the neurosurgeon to drill a small hole into
           the skull from which the tissue is collected. There are risk factors associated
           with the biopsy test, including bleeding from the tumor and brain causing
           infection, stroke, coma, and even death. But the main concern with 
           the stereotactic biopsy is that it is not 100% accurate which may result
           in a serious diagnostic error followed by wrong clinical management of the
           disease.
        </p>
        <p>
            Studies in the recent literature have also reported that automatic 
            computerized detection and diagnosis of the disease, based on medical 
            image analysis, could be a good alternative as it would save radiologists 
            time and also obtain a tested accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Popular machine learning algorithms for classification of are Artificial 
            Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), 
            Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Na√Øve Bayes and 
            Random Field (RF). This Model is using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
            for the detection and classification of the brain tumor.
        </p>
        <p>The model will classify and predict if a patient
            has a brain tumor or not if given his MRI scan image.
        </p>
        <h3>Who should use the Model:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Only a radiologist or neurologist should use the system</li>
            <li>Should have well experience in diagnosing brain disease</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Assumptions And Limitation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Input should be valid MRI image of the brain.</li>
            <li>The results for predicted output will be used with 
                other factors to achieve a conclusion.
            </li>
            <li>The predicted output should not be considered as final
                conclusion for diagnosis.    
            </li>
                
        </ul>
